# :fountain_pen: Create **signed** commits with GitHub Actions

Learn more about [commit signature](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) on GitHub.

## Features

Works with the [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).

- Uses the Git CLI to detect file changes against the file paths provided in the input.
- Uses a single GraphQL mutation request to upload all blob file content.
- Supports glob patterns for file paths.
- Push tag to the new/current commit on a branch.

## Known Limitation
Does not support HTTP request streaming, so the action runner will consume more memory during execution when uploading large blob files.

## Usage
In your workflow, to commit your files, configure a step as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  <job-id>:
    permissions:
      contents: write # grant secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN permission to push file changes
  
    - name: Commit file
      uses: ryancyq/github-signed-commit@v1
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        files: |
          path/to/myfile1
          path/to/*.md
          path/to/**/*.js
        commit-message: Committing files
```

```yaml
jobs:
  <job-id>:
    permissions:
      contents: write # grant secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN permission to push file changes
  
    - name: Commit file
      uses: ryancyq/github-signed-commit@v1
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        files: path/to/myversion
        commit-message: Release new version
        tag: v1.0.3
```

Note: The `GH_TOKEN` environment variable is **required** for GitHub API request authentication.
